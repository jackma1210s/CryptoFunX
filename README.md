### Frontend Design  
1. **Technical Framework**: Use React for user interfaces. Its virtual DOM and component-based model improve development efficiency and maintainability. Integrate Redux or Zustand for state management to ensure real-time synchronization with blockchain data. For example, data changes from user actions on the content creation page are instantly reflected in the interface and synced to the blockchain.  
2. **Wallet Integration**: Support主流钱包 (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect). For MetaMask, clicking "Connect Wallet" triggers the plugin window for user authorization, after which the frontend retrieves the wallet address for authentication. Web3.js enables secure and seamless signing and transaction operations with wallets.  
3. **Smart Contract Interaction**: Use Web3.js or Ethers.js to call contract methods. In peripheral ordering, the frontend collects order details and invokes the sales contract’s order method, passing parameters like order info and payment amount to record transactions on the blockchain.  
4. **Interface Interaction Design**: Adopt responsive design for PC, tablet, and mobile. Create intuitive workflows, such as dropdown menus for agent selection, slider inputs for parameters, and real-time previews on the content creation page. Peripheral product pages use large images, concise descriptions, and price tags, supporting swipe navigation and click-to-view details.  


### AI Agent Design  
1. **Functional Architecture**: The AI Agent includes modules for content generation, peripheral design, and order processing. The content generation module uses deep learning models (e.g., StableDiffusion for images, Runway ML for videos) to create IP content based on user prompts. The peripheral design module generates product designs (e.g., hoodies, mugs) using design algorithms. The order processing module parses orders and interacts with smart contracts/backend (if applicable) to complete workflows.  
2. **Model Selection and Optimization**: Fine-tune pre-trained models (e.g., StableDiffusion, Runway ML) on platform-specific IP and design data using transfer learning. Optimize model performance via compression and quantization to reduce computational costs.  
3. **Interaction Mechanism**: Users interact with the AI Agent via text or voice input. For example, entering "Generate a cute cat animated short" triggers the content generation module, which provides real-time progress updates and allows iterative refinements based on user feedback.  


### Backend Design (Optional)  
1. **Technology Selection**: Use Node.js + Express (event-driven, non-blocking I/O for high concurrency) or Python + Django (rich plugins for rapid development) for backend services.  
2. **Data Storage**: Use relational databases (MySQL/PostgreSQL) for structured data (orders, configurations) to ensure transactional integrity. Employ MongoDB for unstructured data (user creation history) for flexible storage and scaling.  
3. **Interface Design**: Develop RESTful APIs (e.g., /api/content/create for content creation, /api/order/purchase for orders) to validate requests, invoke business logic, and return results for frontend and smart contract interaction.  
4. **Business Logic**: Implement JWT-based user authentication, where valid tokens are issued upon login for subsequent requests. Manage order statuses (e.g., pending payment, shipped) based on blockchain records and business flows. Regularly analyze metrics (user creation volume, sales data) to inform platform operations.  


### Smart Contract Design  
1. **Contract Architecture**: Core contracts include ContentCreation, IPRightsManager, PeripheralSales, and ValueSharing. The ContentCreation contract records hashes, timestamps, and creator addresses. The IPRightsManager handles ownership transfers and authorizations. The PeripheralSales contract manages design uploads, order generation, payment confirmation, and shipping updates. The ValueSharing contract distributes revenue based on predefined rules.  
2. **Development Tools**: Write contracts in Solidity using Truffle or Hardhat for project setup, compilation, testing, and deployment. Truffle simplifies dependency management and project initialization.  
3. **Security Mechanisms**: Follow the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern (validate inputs, update state, then make external calls) to prevent reentrancy attacks. Use OpenZeppelin security libraries for access control and ERC standard implementations, enhancing contract security.
